Broadly speaking, this can be defined as the diverse range of symbolic practices through which communities affirm and maintain their cultural identities using digital media devices and interfaces in a globally networked society. While these practices are structured by deeply unequal power relations, are contradictory, and often come into conflict with one another, collectively they constitute what may be considered a global digital culture.\nA key component of the course is the automation of various forms of creative production, from writing to the visual arts, by natural-language processing computational systems (generally referred to as “artificial intelligence” or “AI”). The course addresses some of the many issues raised by such systems, with a particular focus on questions of aesthetics and the increasingly contested relationship between artists and algorithms. While such systems now demonstrably pass the Turing Test (i.e. pass as human or their products as human-produced), they also compel us to reconsider what we mean by “art,” or “intelligence” itself.\n\n\n\n\nThis is primarily a critical-thinking course, although it includes a practical and production component. This means that it encourages you to think reflexively and analytically about the digitally-mediated cultural practices that the course considers, as well as to participate in them; for example, you will be invited to experiment with image-synthesis and text-generating software and analyze the results using key concepts and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the course, students will:\n\nhave acquired a deeper understanding of the social, cultural, and political dimensions of digital technologies and networked communication;\nbe able to apply critical thinking to contemporary developments in digital culture using relevant analytical concepts and both qualitative and quantitative methodologies such as cultural analytics;\nunderstand basic principles of algorithmic image synthesis on a variety of platforms;\nhave reflected upon and discussed the larger significance of machine learning systems within global networked societies.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected chapters from the texts below will be made available as PDFs; you are nevertheless encouraged to purchase at least several of texts that are of interest and read more of them.\nNote on formats: A number of texts listed in the Bibliography are available as e-books and/or audiobooks.

    "text": "Internet Relay Chat: Quickstart\nINTRODUCTION\nInternet Relay Chat (IRC) is a decentralized communication network that enables encrypted synchronous and asynchronous messaging, without tracking or advertising. It has been used for decades by the computer programming communities around the globe but has more recently begun to be used beyond these.\nThe infrastructure consists of servers (aka nodes) that users connect to using client programs, or web apps in a browser.\nOnce connected to a server, users may join a large number of channels (designated with a #) which may be public or private, and/or may start their own channels.\n\nSETUP\nWhile you can login to servers as a guest, if you’re going to use IRC often you’ll need to register an account with your chosen nickname (aka “Nick”).\n1. Start by installing a client app on your computer. For a cross-platform list of recommended clients, see this page. For mobile clients, iOS doesn’t have many options - Limechat is recommended, but not free; for a free option, try Igloo. See the previous link for Android recommendations.\n2. After installing the client app, connect to an IRC server using your preferred nickname and register an account with your preferred email address and password, then activate it via the message sent to the email account. The standard command is: \n/msg NickServ REGISTER &lt;password&gt; &lt;email address&gt; [after initially logging in with your preferred username and no password]\n3. Once your account is confirmed, you should be able to login from your client app (or the server’s web app) using your nickname and the password you set.\n4. You can then browse lists of channels, join a specific channel, or start one of your own.\n5. Once connected to a server, do /msg NickServ HELP for a list of help commands\n6. On Libera.Chat, connect to the channel #vm303 for the channel for this class.\n\nCOMMANDS\nHere’s a useful page with some basic commands to use on IRC. Key point to keep in mind: \n“Always remember to put the / before commands, and no / when you want the whole channel to see what you are typing. Whatever you type, simply goes to the entire channel. Precede your lines with a / when you wish to execute an IRC command and when you do not wish the text to be sent to the entire channel.”\n\nSERVERS\nLibera.Chat (includes webchat)\nEsperNet (see server list; also has webchat)\n\nGUIDELINES\nYou can’t be logged into a server from your client program and a web browser at the same time. Disconnect from the server on one, then connect with the other. If you try to connect twice the system will log you in with an auto-generated ID, which quickly gets confusing.\n\nXMPP\nIRC is a messaging protocol, just as http is the protocol used for serving web pages. XMPP is a more experimental  protocol that some of you might be interested in checking out. It works similarly to IRC, with servers and clients, and some clients can use either IRC or XMPP servers. Zoom uses XMPP for its chat function and WhatsApp uses a variation of the XMPP protocol.\nYou can register an account on Ben Harris’s server, using either a client app or the webchat app.\n Another XMPP server is xmpp.jp, which also has a webchat option.\nFor a client app, Mac users can try Beagle IM; on iOS, Siskin."

    "text": "Mastodon: Quickstart\nFor a quick intro, watch this video:\n\nThen read one or more of these articles:\n\nA Friendly Introduction to the Fediverse\nGuide to the Fediverse\nWhat Is Mastodon?\n\nIf you’re wondering why you should care about distributed social networks, read this article.\nMastodon is a loosely-connected network of communities, similar in some ways to the federated  structure of the U.S. itself - hence the term fediverse. You can think of it like a large, interconnected network of Twitters, albeit without ads or data-collecting. Mastodon (like Pleroma) is basically software that enables anyone to set up their own social media server and host a community on it - you can even do it yourself. \nEach Mastodon community (more commonly known as an instance) has its own particular flavor, and there are communities in many languages. Each community also has its terms of service, that you should read carefully and observe.\nMastodon instances vary in size from just a handful of members to thousands. Many allow you to register a new account without approval, but for a lot you have to submit a registration request and may not be approved because some instances limit numbers to people who are referred by existing members. This is because communities typically have a very specific focus, whatever that may be. My own community, for example, is comprised mainly of coders, game designers, and digital artists. You can still read posts, though - if you’re interested, here’s my account page.\nInstances are connected with one another, so that you only need to set up an account on one. If you follow someone on a different instance, that person’s posts on that instance will appear in your feed on your instance - the federated model again.\nOf course, if people on one instance don’t like the community on another, for whatever reason, they can simply disconnect from it. So the affordances of instances, and the relations between them, are quite resilient against the usual abuses of social media like trolling, spamming, etc.\nChoosing an instance to register with may seem tricky at the beginning because there are so many! Take your time, and keep in mind that you can always switch instances later if you find another one that you like better - or just have multiple accounts on several instances (I have 5-6).\nAfter you join a community, just hang out there and see what goes on. Be sure to follow the account @feditips@mstdn.social, which has lots of useful tips about using Mastodon and other distributed services."
